# Payup-vBash
Payup -vBash is, mostly, the same program initially written in C and Python called Payup. A bill notifier for your personal PC.

Payup -vBash is the same program I first wrote with C and Python, but after reviewing the program I decided it could be
written completely with a bash scipt that's not only less code, simple, but also much more efficient. This time, I used 
a legendary terminal GUI program called dialog for assistance. Dialogue is really light-weight, easy to use, and a great 
way to produce simple GUIs for the Linux command line(depending on what you're actually using it for, that is).
